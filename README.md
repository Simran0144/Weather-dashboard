1. Project Title / Headline
 🌦 Weather Analytics: Real-time & Forecast Weather Insights Dashboard
A dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze weather patterns, forecast conditions, and visualize air quality trends for better decision-making.

2. Short Description / Purpose
The Weather Dashboard is a visually engaging and analytical Power BI project that displays real-time and forecasted weather data for different cities.
It focuses on key parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, air quality, and sunrise/sunset timings.
This dashboard is intended for use by students, researchers, and analysts who want to monitor weather insights and patterns in a simplified way.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
	•	📊 Power BI Desktop → Main data visualization platform for dashboard creation.
	•	🔄 Power Query → Data cleaning, reshaping, and transformation.
	•	📐 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) → For calculated measures, KPIs, and dynamic visuals.
	•	📂 Data Modeling → Relationships between datasets (current weather, forecast, AQI).
	•	🌐 Weather API / Excel Source → Source of real-time and forecast weather data.

4. Data Source
The data for this dashboard comes from:
	•	🌐 Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or similar) – for real-time and forecasted weather data.
	•	📊 Excel/CSV dataset – for storing historical or sample weather data when API is not live.

The dataset includes key weather metrics such as:
	•	Temperature (current and forecast)
	•	Humidity, pressure, and wind speed
	•	Visibility and UV Index
	•	Sunrise & Sunset timings
	•	Air Quality Index (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3)
	•	Chance of Rain

 5. Features / Highlights
✨ The Weather Dashboard includes the following highlights:
	•	Business Problem: Lack of a simple, visual way to monitor real-time weather and forecast trends.
	•	Goal of the Dashboard: To provide a clear, interactive view of weather conditions that can help users plan daily activities and make informed decisions.
		Key Features:
	•	Current weather overview with city selection
	•	Forecast weather trends for the next 5–7 days
	•	Air Quality Index breakdown with pollutant details
	•	Sunrise & sunset visual representation
	•	Chance of rain across upcoming days
	•	Interactive and user-friendly layout

 6. Business Impact & Insights
    The Weather Dashboard can be used by different stakeholders for decision-making:
	•	🌍 Travelers & Tourists → Plan trips based on weather conditions, forecasted rain, or air quality.
	•	🏢 Event Planners → Schedule outdoor events with confidence by checking real-time weather & rain probability.
	•	🚚 Logistics & Supply Chain Companies → Monitor weather to reduce delays and risks in transportation.
	•	🏥 Healthcare Organizations → Track air quality trends to alert patients with respiratory issues.
	•	🌱 Farmers & Agriculture Sector → Analyze rainfall forecasts and humidity levels to plan crop activities.
